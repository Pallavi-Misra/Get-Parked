Get Parked:
Get Parked is a parking reservation system specially created for college students who are often in a hurry to reach their lectures on time. To help them with time management, Get Parked provides a simplified representation of the parking lot(s) of their college which gives them an overview of all the parking spaces that are either occupied or vacant. It helps them to quickly target a spot without looking for one by roaming around the lot. Another great feature of Get Parked is that you can find the nearest parking spot to the entrance gate that is empty and thus reach to it quickly. These two features helps students to a great extent. Also, it helps you locate your car on the map as well, thus, making it easier for them to reach it in the least time possible.
